Plan for writing the game
=========================

Principles
----------

 * it's an MVP
 * time is limited
 * I use familiar tools
 * I keep feature list brief
 * I skip all petty stuff
 * working prototype as soon as possible


Tech principles
---------------

 * You can obfuscate your code, but it doesn't stop cheaters
 * The only way to protect from cheaters do not send whole word to the client in any form
 * It's small game so I am trying to keep things simple, minimum of instruments, easy setup 


List of tasks
-------------

 1. [x] create basic frontend interface
 2. [x] api for playing the game
 3. [x] refactor frontend
 4. [x] save score
 5. [x] implement tests in GuessWordTest
 
Extra tasks
-----------

 1. [ ] dockerfile and production config
 2. [ ] write tests for frontend
 3. [ ] animate letter boxes for visual speedup
 3. [ ] add admin interface
